# ü¶¥ OsteoCureAI

**OsteoCureAI** is an innovative Streamlit web application designed to provide insights into bone health and osteoporosis risk. This project integrates two powerful AI-driven features:

1.  **Risk Prediction Model**: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict the risk of osteoporosis based on user-provided health and lifestyle data, offering a personalized risk assessment.
2.  **AI Medical Image Analysis ("OsteoCure Vision")**: An advanced AI assistant that analyzes bone-related medical images (like X-rays and MRIs) to identify potential indicators of bone health issues. It provides patient-friendly explanations and evidence-based information, bridging the gap between clinical reports and patient understanding.
